# 🌙 R3C-nightly-ltss  
**C++ → Rust → ASM Experimental LTS Channel**  
> “Long-Term Sustain System for the R3C Ecosystem.”

---

## 🧱 Overview
**R3C-nightly-ltss** is the **nightly experimental branch** of the [R3C ecosystem](https://github.com/0200134/r3c).  
It focuses on verifying the full compiler chain:

```

C++  →  Rust  →  ASM

```

This flow represents the **LLVM-free transpiler pipeline**:  
from legacy systems (C++), through Rust (safe abstraction), down to assembly (bare metal).

## 🧩 Ecosystem Structure
| Layer | Repository | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| 🧱 Core Compiler | [r3c](https://github.com/0200134/r3c) | Self-hosting C++ ↔ Rust transpiler |
| 📦 Package Manager | [cpppm](https://github.com/0200134/cpppm) | C++ Package Layer |
| 🌙 Nightly LTSS | **(This repo)** | Rust-to-ASM experimental channel |

---

## ⚙️ Goals
- Validate **C++ → Rust → ASM** transpilation stability  
- Benchmark **nightly ABI compatibility** across compilers  
- Test **cross-platform NASM** pipelines  
- Simulate **industrial LTSS** behavior for Rust ecosystems
