**🌙 R3C-Nightly-LTSS**

C++ → Rust → ASM Experimental LTS Channel
“Long-Term Sustain System for the R3C Ecosystem.”

   


---

🧭 Overview

R3C-Nightly-LTSS is the nightly experimental channel of the R3C Ecosystem.
It validates the end-to-end compiler independence of R3C — from C++ source to Rust abstraction, then down to assembly — without any reliance on LLVM, Cargo, or centralized build systems.

> 🪶 “From safety to metal — without LLVM.”
The R3C Ecosystem philosophy.



This repository functions as the Long-Term Sustain System (LTSS) testing field for nightly ABI, NASM integration, and compiler stability verification.

🧬 Nightly Validation Workflow

Step	Tool	Output	Description

1️⃣	r3c	.rs	Transpile from legacy C++ to Rust.
2️⃣	rustc-ltss	.asm	Generate clean LLVM-free assembly.
3️⃣	nasm	.obj / .bin	Build target machine code.
4️⃣	ltss-verify	.json report	Verify ABI stability and regression.


Nightly builds are triggered automatically via GitHub Actions.
Each build is archived and compared against the previous 30 versions to measure binary drift and symbol persistence.


---

📊 Performance & Retention Policy

Metric	Description

⏰ Frequency	Nightly (00:00 UTC)
🧮 Retention	365 days of full LTSS logs
🧠 Platforms	Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM, AArch64
🧾 Reports	ABI drift %, ASM reproducibility, function checksum


Artifacts are stored under /ltss/reports/YYYYMMDD/ for long-term tracking.
Historical deltas are compared to detect toolchain regression or ABI divergence.

🌐 Compatibility Matrix

Platform	Compiler	Status	Verified ABI

Linux (x86_64)	GCC + rustc-ltss	✅ Stable	✔
Windows (MSVC + NASM)	rustc-nightly	🧩 Active	✔
macOS	Apple Clang + rustc	🧪 Experimental	⏳
Embedded (ARM / AArch64)	Cross NASM	🧠 Ongoing	⏳

🧭 LTSS Philosophy

LTSS (Long-Term Sustain System) ensures toolchain reproducibility over decades, not months.

Principle	Meaning

🧱 Stability	Predictable output across compiler versions.
🧩 Transparency	No hidden IR or vendor lock.
⚙️ Rebuildability	Every binary can be rebuilt from pure source.
🧠 Auditability	Assembly-level equivalence reports archived.
🪶 Independence	LLVM, Cargo, and Registry-free pipeline.



---

🧭 Ecosystem Synergy

Project	Role

🦀 Rust-LTSS	Long-term Rust sustainability layer.
⚙️ Beyond-LLVM	Post-LLVM backend research.
🧠 Post-NASM	Next-generation NASM verification system.
🪶 R3C	Core C++ ↔ Rust transpiler.
📦 cpppm	C++ package management for LTSS ecosystems.
